;; # My Agenda
;;
^{::clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}
(clerk/with-viewer mermaid-viewer {:nextjournal.clerk/width :full}
  plt-history-timeline)
;; PL history has two streams (actually more but this is rhetoric, so I can lie and call it simplicity!)
;;
;; I'm assuming most people here, like most of the industry are on the imperative side.
;;
;; I'd like to do one thing, and excite, and encourage you to explore ideas on the functional side.

;; ---
;; # My impossible task
;;
;; - Functional Programming and Clojure are both golden gates into a rich seam of ideas.
;; - The ideas can challenge your deepest held assumptions about the craft of software,
;; - ...including assumptions on the nature of computation, design, systems, simplicity, and complexity itself.

;; ---
;; # (1962) Thomas Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions
;;
;; - Introduced the ideas of Paradigms & Paradigm shifts

;; ---
;; # Incommensurability of paradigms
;;
;; - A barrier to crossing from the imperative paradigm to functional is that from the perspective of just one paradigm you can't objectively compare the other.
;; - You need to learn the other paradigm to discover what the fuss is about
;; - Learning paradigm's is hard because they fundamentally change your terms of reference
;;
^{::clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}
(clerk/with-viewer mermaid-viewer {:nextjournal.clerk/width :full}
  plt-history-timeline)

;; ---
;; # My impossible task
;;
;; - The other reason this is hard, is there's so much cool stuff to talk about!
;; - Potentially over 80 years worth of cool stuff!
;; - So I don't have time to go into anything too much
;; - I'm just going to throw lots of things I think are cool at you, and hope something resonates!

;; ---
;; # But maybe, it's easier than I make out...
;;
;; - ... because the stuff I'll show you is probably _simpler_ than you're used to üëç

;; ---
;; # but beware Simple != Easy
;;
;; - Rich Hickey (Clojure's creator) offers a [rigorous definition of simplicity](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md).
;; - We confuse Simple with Easy all the time
;; - To make things simple means:
;;   - To "decomplect", to tear apart, to isolate
;;   - individual concepts
;; - To make things easy means:
;;   - To have them to hand
;;   - To make them familiar
;;   - Frequently also to combine things together
;;
;; - Confusing these things causes huge problems
;;

;; ---
;; # Simple is often hard but not complex
;;
;; - You might simplify something by turning into 5 separate isolated things
;; - You will have more things to deal with
;; - But they will be more reusable, combinable, useful and understandable
;; - No silver bullets, but being mindful of these trade-offs prevents many problems

;; ---
;; # Simple Made Easy
;;
;; - If you only take away one idea, it should probably be this one
;; - Watch this talk or [read the transcript](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md)

;; ---
;; # Simple != Easy
;;
;; - It's no surprise that Rich Hickey (a Functional Programmer and Lisp developer) observed this
;; - As Lisp and the roots of Functional Programming implicitly treat simplicity in this way

;; ---
;; # Learning this stuff is a simple way to...
;;
;; 1. Sound a lot smarter than you are

;; # Ok, so what is Clojure then?
;;
;; - A modern functional programming language
;; - Is a dialect of Lisp (but not a direct descendent of any prior Lisp)
;; - Created in 2007
;; - Open source (EPL license)
;; - Compiles to Java and Runs on the JVM
;; - Dynamically typed
;; - Created and led by Rich Hickey
;; - Has a strong development philosophy behind it

;; ---
;; # What else is Clojure?
;;
;; - ... a small but vibrant open-source community
;;   - I recommend the [Clojurian Slack](http://clojurians.net/)
;;   - Extremely welcoming (our female developers say great things about it too!)
;; - a dialect of similar "hosted languages"

;; ---
;; # The best of boring
;;
;; - Most of Clojure Core Team work for Nubank
;;   - Worth > $30bn (now one of the biggest banks in Brazil)
;; - Nubank have built their business on Clojure (thousands of systems)
;;   - Acquired the core team because they rely heavily on Clojure & [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/)
;; - It's reliable and predictable
;; - Host language (java) interop is great so there are usable libraries available for almost everything

;; ---
;; # The best of boring
;;
;; - It changes slowly and purposefully (roughly one stable release p/year)
;;   - Improvements are well thought out and conservative
;; - Follows a strong philosophy of not making breaking changes
;;   - See Rich Hickey's talk [Spec-ulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk)
;;   - Two kinds of change
;;     - Growth (accretion, relaxation, fixation)
;;     - Breakage (requiring more or providing less)
;;   - Embodied in tools.deps (package manager) version resolution
;;   - language features like namespaced keywords / clojure.spec etc
;; - The libraries and community tend to follow this advice
;;   - It's not unusual to update every dependency in a legacy apps and have them still work

;; # Hosted language
;;
;; Clojure and it's dialects are hosted languages, and expect to
;; interoperate with a host language.
;;
;; In the case of:
;;
;; - Clojure -> JVM (including GraalVM)
;; - Clojurescript -> Javascript
;; - ClojureDart -> Dart (& Flutter)
;; - SCI -> cljc (clojure/clojurescript)
;; - Babashka compiles SCI with GraalVM interop


;; ---
;; # What could I use Clojure for?
;;
;; - Almost everything
;; - General purpose language
;; - It's pretty fast too (compiled, but feels like it's interpreted)
;; - Constrained mainly by it's host languages/runtimes (Java, Javascript, GraalVM, Dart)
;; - Constrained mainly by your willingness to use it

;; ---
;; # But other languages have functions and a REPL too!
;;
;; - Mutable state makes those REPLs significantly less useful
;; - Value semantics & Equality are a big deal here too!
;;   - Deep copies/comparisons always work (and are always intuitive)
;; - These properties mean you can build your program from inside it

;; # Some cool Databases made in Clojure
;;
;; - Datomic (a triplestore but with transaction time)
;; - XTDB (like Datomic but bitemporal)
;; - Other Datalog's
;;   - TPXImpact's [Matcha](https://github.com/Swirrl/matcha)
;;   - [Asami](https://github.com/quoll/asami)
;;   - [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript)

;; # Data science
;;
;; - A promising area for Clojure
;; - [Clerk notebooks](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk)
;; - Language truly embraces Data
