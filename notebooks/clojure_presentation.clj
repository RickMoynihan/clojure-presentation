;; # ðŸ‘‹ About me
;;
;; - Over 20 years Software Engineering
;; - Worked for
;;   - 4 startups
;;   - One agency
;; - Spent the last decade at Swirrl
;;    - Working on data infrastructure & services for government

;; # I want to convince you of three things

;; ---
;; # 1. Clojure is a boring language

;; ---
;; # 1. Clojure is a boring language
;;
;; _* boring enough that you could possibly use it at work_


;; ---
;; # 2. Clojure is full of big contrarian ideas, which are interesting and exciting...

;; ---
;; # 2. ... and learning it may radically change your approach to software development and data _*_
;;
;; _* for the better_

;; ---
;; # 3. And finally that programming in Clojure is a lot of fun


;; ---
;; # What is Clojure?
;;
;; - A modern functional programming language in the Lisp family of languages
;; - Created in 2007
;; - Open source
;; - Compiles to Java and Runs on the JVM
;; - Dynamically typed
;; - Created and led by Rich Hickey
;; - Has a strong development philosophy behind it

;; ---
;; # What else is Clojure?
;;
;; - ... a small but vibrant open-source community
;; - a dialect of similar "hosted languages"
;;    - [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
;;    - [Clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org/)
;;    - [Small Clojure Interpreter](https://github.com/babashka/sci) & [Babashka](https://babashka.org/)
;;    - [ClojureCLR](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr)
;;    - [Clojure Dart](https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart)

;; ---
;; # What else is Clojure?
;;
;; - Many big ideas carefully composed together
;; - A case study in simplicity, elegance and design

;; ---
;; # Chapter 1: A boring language

;; ---
;; # Chapter 1: A boring language
;;
;; - Most of Clojure Core Team work for Nubank
;; - Nubank have built their business on Clojure (thousands of systems)
;; - It's reliable and predictable
;; - Host language (java) interop is great so there are usable libraries available for almost everythingb

;; ---
;; # Chapter 1: A boring language
;;
;; - It changes slowly and purposefully (roughly one stable release p/year)
;;   - Improvements are well thought out and conservative
;; - Follows a strong philosophy of not making breaking changes
;;   - See Rich Hickey's talk [Spec-ulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk)
;;   - Two kinds of change
;;     - Growth (accretion, relaxation, fixation)
;;     - Breakage (requiring more or providing less)
;;   - Embodied in tools.deps (package manager) version resolution
;;   - language features like namespaced keywords / clojure.spec etc
;; - The libraries and community tend to follow this advice
;;   - It's not unusual to update every dependency in a legacy apps and have them still work

;; ---
;;
;; # Chapter 2: Contrarian, interesting and exciting


;; ---
;; # Big ideas
;;
;; 1. Lisp
;; 2. The value of values
;; 3. Programming as a dialogue
;; 4. Simplicity (a rigorous definition)
;; 5. Inside out programming
;; 6. Homoiconic Representation
;; 7. Hosted languages
;; 8. Move slow and purposefully, don't break things

;; ---
;; # What Learning a Lisp teaches you
;;
;; - Embodies the essential minimal essence of what it means to compute
;; - Makes it trivially easy to extend the language and compiler
;; - Liberates programming language development out of the domain of computer scientists in ways practitioners can understand.  See the book [Lisp in Small Pieces](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lisp-Small-Pieces-Christian-Queinnec/dp/0521545668)
;;    - A practical example of this is [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/) which implements go's CSP as a library in Clojure!

;; # So what is Clojure?
;;
;; - Clojure is a Lisp
;; - ...but is not a direct descendant of any prior Lisp
;; - Unlike historic Lisps it
;;   - Focuses on Functional Programming with immutable data
;;   - is intentionally hosted, in that it compiles to and runs on the runtime of another language, such as the JVM
