# Clojure: Two doors to great ideas

See the presentation [slides here](https://swirrl.github.io/clojure_presentation/)

## Implementation & Developing

Note this presentation is developed as a [Clerk](https://clerk.vision)
[Slideshow](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk-slideshow), and is
written in Clojure.

To build new slides eval the build snippet at a REPL in user.clj.

[The code behind the presentation is here](./notebooks/clojure_presentation.clj).

_NOTE: Works & Tested on Java 17_
